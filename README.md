# A Simple MIDI Pedal Controller

Because I couldn't afford one, so make one myself.

## What can it do

* Send midi signals;
* The button mode (toggle/gate) can be changed on the go;
* Display informations on the screen(mode, midicc, value...)
* Two banks of midi/mode mapping.(NotImplemented)

code just suck, because I don't know how to write c++
